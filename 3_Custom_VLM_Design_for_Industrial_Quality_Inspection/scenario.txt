Scenario: A semiconductor manufacturer needs an offline AI system for PCB inspection where 
inspectors ask natural language questions about defects and receive structured responses with 
locations and confidence scores (<2s inference). Available: 50,000 PCB images with defect 
bounding boxes (no QA pairs). Generic VLMs hallucinate.
